Errors:
•	Using SOLID principles can be better.
•	The code does not high cohesion and low coupling.
•	Some code in the class are hard.
•	SQL Sentences into the code, it's better usign store procedures.
Recommendations :
•	Separate the code using design patterns.
•	JobLogger class do different processes, maybe can be separate in diferente class where each one do only a specific task.
•	Can be better using some pattern design.
•	Can use repository Pattern to order the code.
